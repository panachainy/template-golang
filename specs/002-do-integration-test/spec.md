# Feature Specification: Integration Test for AuthHandler Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-do-integration-test`  
**Created**: September 14, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "do integration test for AuthHandler interface in modules/auth/handlers/authHttp.go"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user interacts with the authentication endpoints provided by the AuthHandler interface to log in, handle authentication callbacks, log out, and access an example endpoint. Integration tests are required to verify these flows end-to-end.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid login request, **When** the user submits credentials, **Then** the system authenticates and returns a valid token.
2. **Given** an authentication callback from an external provider, **When** the callback is received, **Then** the system processes the callback and authenticates the user.
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** the user requests logout, **Then** the system invalidates the session and confirms logout.
4. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** the user accesses the example endpoint, **Then** the system returns the expected response.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when invalid credentials are provided during login?
- How does the system handle an invalid or expired authentication callback?
- What is the response if a logout request is made without an active session?
- How does the system respond if the example endpoint is accessed without authentication?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to log in via the AuthHandler interface.
- **FR-002**: System MUST process authentication callbacks and authenticate users.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to log out and invalidate sessions.
- **FR-004**: System MUST restrict access to the example endpoint to authenticated users.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle error scenarios for invalid login, callback, and logout requests.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear error messages for failed authentication attempts.
- **FR-007**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What external authentication providers are supported for AuthCallback?]
- **FR-008**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected response format for the example endpoint?]

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents an authenticated user, with attributes such as user ID, authentication token, session state.
- **AuthSession**: Represents the authentication session, including token validity, expiration, and logout state.
